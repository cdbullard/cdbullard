### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Connor Bullard and I currently work as a software engineer in the tech industry, primarily utilizing C#, JavaScript, and SQL. I began my professional career as an insurance agent, but after a lifelong passion for technology I finally pursued computer science in 2020 during the beginning days of the pandemic. My journey formally began through enrolling in two classes as Wake Tech Community College, where I began studying SQL and Python. After my first semester I was accepted into East Carolina University's Masters in Computer Science program. I am on track to graduate with my masters degree in May 2023 and have thoroughly enjoyed my time learning about this limitless field.

As a software engineer I focus on providing enterprise-grade solutions with previous particular attention given to data migration and ETL tasks (usually using SQL mapping scripts and SSIS). I strive to bring my best to my team and not only have quick and effective turnaround on solutions, but also to be a resource for my teammates. When we work together, we all win.

My goal is to use the skills I have developed to help others in a meaningful way.

### My Skills

**Languages**: C#, SQL, Java, JavaScript, Python

**Software**: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, SSMS, SSIS
